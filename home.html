  <div class="side">
      <p>Goal 4, Quality Education is apart of a greater aim of the UN to ensure a sustainable future that is focused around the health, safety, and prosperity of every single person on the planet. As a specific Goal, Quality Education is extremely prioritized and will help to provide a substantial education for primary, secondary, and even collegient level students. <p>Being a child in present society, it is prioritized that every single one of them should have equal right and accessibility to some form of education that is able to transform their understanding in literature and maths to allow them to develop their own perspective on the real world around them. </p>
    
  </div>
  <div class="right">
    <p> Mainly, there are portions of our population that are not completing education. According to UN.org, 265 million children are out of school in developing countries. This admits 21% of all children into poverty. Education as a whole is crucial as it is a huge influence in determining many people's success and is important to have access to in order to make an impact on our world. <p>However, education often costs unaffordable money or either cannot be properly funded to incorporate proper teachers, resources, or facilities. As an organization, the UN and the greater population can collaborate to help the less fortunate children around the world, especially those within Sub-Saharan Africa that certainly deserve education. </p>

<div class="content">
  <p> Globally, there are numerous factors that go towards the prevention of children attending schools, however, mainly, they are most influenced by violence that occurs close to their home as nearly 50% of all out of school children directly live inside conflict affected areas.<p><img src="violence.png" id="violence"></p>

  <p>Even with schools being free and accessible, there are still cases where children are not getting the correct resources, teachers, or facilities that contribute to healthy learning habits.
