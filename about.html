    <p> As an agreement between almost every country and the United Nations, the Sustainable Development Goals are split into 17 different prioritized categories that outline 17 different keys to sustainability amonst all regions on the planet. These goals ensure peaceful and prosperity for every person on the planet.<p>Realistically, these goals must be achieved and not just hoped for, which is why they were agreed to be aimed to be achieved by 2030. These goals are reached by meeting several indicator goals and targets that are a part of every Sustainable Development Goal. These targets are organized so these SDG's are more feasible and easier to reach. </p>

    <h5>This problem's significance lies in its ability to affect our future. Without education, it constraints children from learning crucial life lessons or concepts in order to develop their own opinion on global issues. Also, disregarding what one strives to accomplish, their success is often determined by the amount of opportunities that they get. Subjectively, education is the best "free" opportunity that can be gifted to any person. This makes it extremely important that we create solutions that solve today's everlasting problems.</h5>
